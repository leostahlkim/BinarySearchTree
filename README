Program Purpose:

    The purpose of this class is to be a fully function implementation
of a binary search tree with built in functions for insertion, deletion,
creation and more.


Files:

    BinarySearchTree.h:
        Class declaration for the BinarySearchTree class. 
    
    BinarySearchTree.cpp:
        Class implementation for the BinarySearchTree class.
    
    hw3.cpp:
        Test driver for testing the BinarySearchTree class against the
    reference implementation.

    unit_tests.h:
        Contains all the unit tests I ran in testing my programs.

    Makefile:
        Contains all the make rules to build the necessary .o and testing 
    files.

How to Compile/run:

    While there is not a final main executable program for this project, to
make and compile the hw3 test driver you:
    - Compile using
        make hw3
    - run executable with
        ./hw3
To make and compile the unit_tests you just have to type the command unit_test
while on the Tufts CS servers.

Testing:
    In order to test my BinarySearchTree class I used the unit testing 
framework. After every function I wrote, I would create a variety of different
unit tests for it that covered every possible edge case I couldthink of. When
unit tests failed, I would print error messages using cout at different points
in the function to see where the function was failing.
    After I had tested all of my BinarySearchTree class functions with unit
testing, I then used diff testing with my hw3 testing driver and the reference
implementation to ensure all the outputs matched.
